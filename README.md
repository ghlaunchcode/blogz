Quick Start
===========

The quick start is now even quicker!

Initialize Project
------------------

The project init is now very streamlined and automatic.

Unmentioned dependencies include: \* sh, bash (for scripts) \* virtualenv (for creating the virtual environment) \* python3 (for the app itself) \* pip3 (for app dependencies) \* libffi-dev (for certain dependencies) \* MySQL server, client, CLI (for the database) \* \* mariaDB should work as well (providing mysql interfaces) \* asciidoc, pandoc (for converting asciidoc to markdown) \* xfce4-terminal (for gui scripts)

### GUI script

> **Note**
>
> requires xfce4-terminal I could have generalized more, but the command line options differed.

`$ gui_init_all`

### Script

`$ util/init_all`

Run the server
--------------

Before the application will work, a server needs started.

This server will listen at port 5000 by default.

This is accessible via:

`http://localhost:5000`

or

`http://127.0.0.1:5000`

on simpler browsers, like *dillo*, *links*, *lynx*, etc.

### GUI

`$ gui_start_server`

### Script

\#TODO!

### Manual

`$ . mega/bin/activate`

> **Note**
>
> The first period "." is necessary, and there IS a space after. The *source* command can be used instead.

Old Quick Start
===============

Will require password for MySQL *root*

\$ util/init\_all && util/startserver\_init

Initializes: \* schema \* user / roles \* virtual environment *mega* \* BlogzEntry \* BlogzUser \* Creates a *root* user for BlogzUser

Initialize the Virtual Environment
==================================

In lieu of using something like *anaconda*, the virtual environment is created manually.

The initenv script located in the util folder should do the trick.

`$ util/init_virtualenv`

Create DATABASE
===============

Using Script
------------

The database (and user) can now be created with a simple script.

`$ util/init_dbenv`

This script executes queries (3, actually) in util/createdb.sql.

> **Note**
>
> the script assumes a user *root*, and will require entry of that password.

(Simply hardcoding the password is very bad practice and would be recorded in bash history)

Using mysql-workbench
---------------------

-   Login to MySQL server "MySQL@localhost:3306" using user "root" and the correct authentication

-   \* Password may be a string or stored already in keychain

-   Create a new schema in the connected server

-   \* Set the name to blogz

-   \* Set default collation to utf8-default

`` CREATE SCHEMA `blogz `` DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 ;\`

-   Create a new user

-   \* Set the name to "blogz"

-   \* Set the Limit to Hosts matching "localhost" or "127.0.0.1"

-   \* Set the password to "blogz"

-   \* Create a new schema privilege definition for "blogz"

-   \* \* Set ALL (for now)

Create initial TABLES
=====================

If the dependencies are only available to the virtual environment, fire that up

Using models.py
---------------

> **Note**
>
> this is the manual way. The virtual environment is required.

`$ python models.py`

To more easily accomplish this, try:

`$ util/init_models`

The virtual environment will be handled automatically.

Using CLI
---------

Open python CLI: `$ python`

`>>> from app import db` CREATE the TABLES `>>> from models import BlogzUser, BlogzEntry` `>>> db.create_all()`

CREATE a root user with a high loglevel (and simple password): `>>> new_user = BlogzUser( "root", "root" "root@localhost", 7 )` `>>> db.session.add( new_user )` `>>> db.session.commit()`

New Walkthru
============

> **Note**
>
> this no longer exists!!!

\$ util/startserver

Old Walkthru
============

\$ source mega/bin/activate

\$ python app.py

Starting Over
=============

GUI Script
----------

`$ ./gui_rm_all`

Script
------

`$ /util/rm_all`

Dev-Related
===========

Dependencies
------------

The dependencies for the app are now located in a requirements file called *depends*.

This will be passed to the virtual environment 'megaâ€™s pip3.

`$ util/init_pydep`

> **Note**
>
> this requires the virtual environment (mega).

Initialize that environment with

`$ util/init_virtualenv`

Templates
---------

Located in the *templates* folder

Variables
---------

\#TODO: these are deprecated!!!

ghSite\_Name ghPage\_Title

The database
------------

The database should be called blogz and accessible by user blogz.

For simplicity, the password is *blogz*.

> **Note**
>
> only should be accessible by localhost.

To Initialize the database and user with proper privileges (for localhost):

`$ util/init_dbenv`

To create the actual models (tables), use:

`$ util/init_models`

Please note this requires the virtual environment and the python dependencies:

`$ util/init_virtualenv && util/init_pydep`
